### Link Prediction using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

This repository provides a Python implementation of **link prediction** using **standard Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**. NMF is a dimensionality reduction technique that can uncover latent patterns in adjacency matrices for predicting missing or future links.

### ðŸ“Š Method Overview

- **NMF** is applied to the graph's adjacency matrix.
- Matrix factorization decomposes it into two low-rank non-negative matrices.
- The reconstructed matrix is used to infer potential links.
